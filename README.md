This repository contains the materials for a workshop held at [MZES Social Science Data Lab](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/).
It inludes slides `workshop_slides.pdf` and an example text data set `multilingual_data_annotated_translated.csv` which is a subset of the [REMINDER media corpus](https://doi.org/10.11587/IEGQ1B).

## Workshop Outline
Automated text analysis methods have become popular in computational social science. They appeal as they promise the automated extraction of meaning from large numbers of documents, thus allowing to better understand the contents and, indirectly, the document creators and audiences. While the existing techniques are well established for English-language text, the situation is different when it comes to the study of text in more than one language and in languages other than English. Yet it is precisely these multilingual techniques that are needed for (country) comparative research designs. 

This workshop motivates the need for comparative social science studies that base their interpretations on text data. The main part provides guidance and many practical tips to help plan such research designs. In particular, it covers considerations related to the definition of comparative research goals, the selection of a case comparative text data set, the definition of concepts, and the creation of a human annotated validation baseline. The workshop focuses then on methodological strategies that can be employed to obtain measurements from a multilingual corpus with automated text analysis methods. All steps are illustrated with an applied example.
